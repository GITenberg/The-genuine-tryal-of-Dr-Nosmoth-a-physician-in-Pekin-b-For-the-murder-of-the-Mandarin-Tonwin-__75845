Before we enter upon
this remarkable Tryal, it will
not be improper to inform
the Reader of some Customs
amongst the <i>Chinese</i>, which
differ from those in other Countries of
<i>Europe</i>.</p>

<p class='c015'>Those People are great Encouragers of
all useful Learning; which they endeavour
on all Occasions, to turn to the Benefit of
the publick in general, and the Ease and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>Happiness of every individual Subject in
that vast Empire.</p>

<p class='c015'>There are publick Schools in all the Provinces
and great Cities of the Empire, for
the Education of Youth in the liberal as
well as mechanick Arts; where the Genius
of the Children are carefully studied and
improved in those Arts to which Nature
seems to have given them the strongest Bent
without consulting the Whim or Pride of
the Parents; by this means, it’s no rare
thing to see the Son of a Nobleman drudging
at the meanest Handicraft; and that of a
Peasant shining in the highest Orb of Life.</p>

<p class='c015'>Birth, Title, or Riches, give amongst
these people no Claim to the smallest Preferment;
Merit only recommends the
Man to Encouragement in that Sphere of
Life, to which his natural Genius has
fitted him.</p>

<p class='c015'>When a vacancy in any of the Offices
happens, the Candidates are chosen out
of the publick Schools; and the Person
fittest for the Employment always is
chosen, without Respect of Persons.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>In this Country, the <i>Physician</i> is a very
considerable Office; not only in the Emperor’s
Court, but in that of all the
<i>Mandarines</i> or great Governors and
Officers of State.</p>

<p class='c015'>Before any Man is preferr’d to the
Office of Physician, either to the Sovereign
or to any of his great Men, he undergoes
a strict and impartial Examination,
as to his Knowledge of the Theory and
Practice of Physick, as well as of the
other Branches of Learning, which are
necessary to compleat the wise Physician.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Examiners are not those of his
own Profession; but the Great Council
of <i>Mandarines</i>; who are Men who have
been found universally qualified in all
the Branches of humane Literature, before
they were admitted to be of this
Council; which is the supream Council
of the Empire, and some what resembles
our House of Peers, only they seem to
be vested with much higher Powers.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>When the Person so examin’d is found
qualified, he has a Certificate sign’d by the
President of the Court, which empowers
him to practice, as a Doctor under the Regulations
which are prescribed by it; from
whence, he must deviate, upon no Account
under the Pain of Death.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Physicians, are held in great Esteem
and Veneration; are there modest
in their Behaviour; of strict morals, and
universal Benevolence, most of them observe
as great a Chastity of Manners, as
the Clergy; and value themselves upon
their Piety and the Veneration of the
Gods, whose Worship they think it is the
Duty of their Function to propagate, as
much as if they were daily at the Altar:
They are Men of good Nature and
Humanity, and abound in Acts of Benificence
and Charity; Opportunities to
exercise which, they covet as much as
Employment in their Profession: They
dare not refuse to attend the meanest
Person who calls for their Assistance; and
if a Beggar, send for a Physician, before a
<i>Mandarin</i>, he must go to the Beggar, tho’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>the <i>Mandarin</i> should be in never so much
Want of him; and the good natured
Man, not only assists his Patient with his
Counsel, but supplys his Wants.</p>

<p class='c015'>When the Physician, attends on a
Patient, he enters upon a Book his Case,
with every minute Circumstance relating
to the Distemper; together with the
Medicines administred and their Effects
during the whole Process; whether the
Patient dies or Lives, this Book, he is obliged
to return within a limited Time,
to an Office kept for that Purpose. If
he upon any Occasion falsifies the Case,
or has gone out of the ordinary, Course
of Practice, if any Accident happens to
the Patient he is surely punished.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Emperor’s Physicians are always
put to Death when he dies; and
those of other Persons, are try’d by
the Court of Mandarines, upon Application
of the Friends of the deceas’d, and
put to death or otherwise punish’d according
to the Nature of their Crime,
from whence we may judge, that it is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>very dangerous thing, to be of that Profession
in this Country; however there are but
few Instances where the Physicians of private
Persons have been put to death;
as a Pretence to the Knowledge of Physick,
rashness or Impudence, will not in this
Country, obtain a <i>Diploma</i>, none but
Men of Merit are of the Faculty: These
are obliged to make Conscience of their
Business; and dare not venture to try
Experiments; there are no Apothecary’s
whose Interest the Doctor has Occasion to
consider in the <i>Recipe</i>; he prepares the
Medicine himself, and is too much interested
in the Success, to give any more
than he thinks necessary; the Officinals in
their Dispensary, are so few, that you
may write them all on a quarter of a
Sheet of Paper; and he never makes a
Bill for his Druggs? but is paid so much
a Visit, whether he gives any Physick or
not. Thus he is not under the least Temptation
to make an Apothecarys Shop of
his Patient’s Belly; but carefully watches
Nature; and assists her when she is
weak to the best of his Skill; but leaves
her to her self, when she is strong enough
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>to bring about her Designs without his
Aid.</p>

<p class='c015'>Before the present Tryal, there had
not been one at <i>Pekin</i>, for near twenty
Years; which made this make a considerable
Noise through the whole Empire:
The Patient happened to be the <i>Mandarin</i>
<span class='sc'>Tonwin</span>; a Man of great Authority,
much esteemed and trusted by the Emperor;
who had made him Treasurer to his
Army; by whom he was not less loved
than by the People in General; as he did
Justice to the first, in their Pay, and promoted
the Interest of the last to the utmost
of his Power; he was a Friend to
Mankind in General, but particularly to
the virtuous, and thought that Day Ill-spent
wherein he had not given them
Proof of his Humanity and Bounty: The
Death of this great Man, so universally
esteemed, was somewhat sudden; and his
Physician was blamed by some, tho’ not
by the <i>Mandarines</i> nearest Friends; however,
it was <a id='tn1'></a>wispered about, that he had
deviated from the Rules laid down by
the great Council of <i>Mandarines</i>; and by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>the Malice of the Doctor’s Enemies, the
Clamour became publick; in so much,
that the great Council, ordered the Register
of the Case to be inspected; and
the <i>Senescal</i> was ordered to draw up an Accusation
against the Doctor; with a Copy
of which he was served and taken into
Custody; and a Time appointed for a
solemn Tryal before that High Tribunal.</p>

<p class='c015'>People were variously affected with the
Preparation for the Tryal; some thought
the Doctor guilty; others thought him innocent;
and this only the Effects of the secret
Machinations of his Enemies: Those
of his own Profession, for what Reason I
am not able to learn, were his most open
Enemies; and thought by all to be his secret
Accusers; however, the Doctor seem’d
not at all dismay’d; but hugg’d himself
in reflecting on his own Innocence, which
comforted him the more, that he had not
the least Suspicion, that the high Tribunal,
before which <a id='tn2'></a>he was to be try’d,
would mix any Partiality in their Sentence.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>I have taken Care to use as few <i>Chinese</i>
Terms of Law as possible; and have chose
such <i>English</i> Words, as seem’d to come
nearest to the Meaning of the Original;
and in order to make the whole more
comprehensible to an <i>English</i> Reader, I
have all along substituted some <i>English</i>
Forms, where I could with Propriety,
especially <a id='tn3'></a>where they served to make the
Tryal more Intelligible.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c018'>On the Day appointed for the Tryal,
the great Council of Mandarins
assembled in a great Hall, in the second
Court of the King’s Palace, the President
was seated on a Throne, under the Canopy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>of State; the Ensigns of his high
Office being carried before him, and attended
by twenty four Officers with
drawn Sabres in their Hands, who stood
round the Steps of the Throne; the rest
of the Mandarins were ranged on each
Hand of him in their Robes of Honour.
Silence being commanded in the Name of
the Emperor, the Prisoner was brought
to the Bar, to which he approached by
making three Obeysances, and then lay
prostrate on his Face, till the President
commanded him to rise; acquainting
him, that he had nothing to fear but his
own Guilt; for if that was not found in
him, the Court would not only acquit
him, but load him with new Honours;
after a short Speech to this Purpose, Silence
was again commanded, and the
<i>Mandarin</i> Secretary, was ordered to read
his Indictment; which was conceived
in Words to this Effect.</p>

<p class='c015'>You <i>Nosmoth</i>, Doctor of the Divine
<a id='tn4'></a>Science of Physick, stand indicted before
this Sovereign Court, at the Suit of our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>Sovereign Lord the most High, mighty,
and Puisant Emperor, <i>Abdaer</i> Emperor
to the World, Lord of Vast Territories,
Commander of Kings, and Beloved of
the Sun, to whom all are Slaves &#38;c. &#38;c.
For, that you not having the fear of the
Mighty Gods before your Eyes, but being
Instigated thereto, by the <a id='tn5'></a>Suggestion
of the Black Angel, who Commandeth
the Burning Lake; and with malice in
your Heart, and out of Envy and premedicated
spite, to the Great <i>Mandarin
Tonwin</i> Slave of our Great Emperor, and
Treasurer of his Invincible Armies, Didst
on the Sixth Day, of the Second Month, of
the Year of our Empire, six thousand seven
hundred and forty six, conspire and contrive
the Death of the said <i>Mandarin</i>; that is on
one or other of the Days of the said second
Month; thou didst maliciously, with
a certain Instrument made of Steel, called
a <i>Lancet</i>, stab the said <i>Mandarin</i> in the
right and left Arm, and didst take from
him, a large Quantity of his Blood, to
the amount of fifty seven Ounces; and
likewise didst prevail with the said <i>Mandarin</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>by false unreasonable, and scandalous
Suggestions, to swallow certain Quantities
unknown, of poisonous Drugs, for
sixteen or seventeen Days together; and likewise
caused during the said Space of Time,
to be introduced into the <i>Anus</i>, (Anglice
A——se,) of the said Mandarin, a certain
Machine, call’d a Clister-Pipe,
through which was squeezed a certain further
Quantity of poisonous Drugs, into
his Bowels; and contrary to the Duty of
your Profession as a Physician, ordered
the said Mandarin, then your Patient, to
eat of Meats and Drinks, improper for his
Condition, and neglected to administer
such Medicines, as you knew by the Help
of the great God Paphor,<a id='rA'></a><a href='#fA' class='c019'><sup>[A]</sup></a> would have restored
him to Health; by all which your
Acts of Malice, before-mentioned, you
permitted the Angel of Death, to carry
away the said <i>Mandarin</i>; by which Means
our great Emperor, has lost a faithful
Slave, the Empire an useful Member,
and the distressed a great Protector; this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>is your Accusation, are you Guilty or not
Guilty.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>My Lord President, before we, that
have the Honour to be of Council for the
Prisoner, can permit him to plead, we
humbly beg Leave to offer some Reasons
to the august Court, why an Indictment
in this Case does not lye against our Client,
we humbly apprehend, that the
Consent of the Friends of the Deceased,
ought to have been specified in the Indictment,
since the great Mandarin, the
Manner of whose Death is now in Question,
is not of the Blood Royal; there never
has been an Instance before, where a
Physician has been tried, but upon the
Application of the Friends of his Patient:
This is introducing an unheard of Practice,
and subjecting the Gentlemen of that
Profession, to uncommon Hardships; who
are already but too much at the Mercy of
the designing and malicious: We have an
Affidavit ready to read to your Lordships,
sign’d by the nearest <a id='tn6'></a>agnat of the deceas’d
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>Lord; wherein they disclaim the Prosecution,
and express their Satisfaction;
both of the Skill and Integrity of our
Client; therefore we hope this august
Court will quash this Indictment.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c020'>
    <div><span class='c021'><i>Council for the Emperor.</i></span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>My Lord, We are not a little surpriz’d
to find the Council for the Prisoner,
make such an extraordinary Motion;
when they must certainly know,
what gave Rise to this Tryal: The Prisoner
at the Bar, in Conversation with
some of his own Profession, found that
they did not approve of his Method in
this Particular; he was offended at their
pretending to find Fault with his Practice;
which he asserted he could justify;
This produced a Dispute amongst them,
in which he thought he was scandaliz’d,
and brought his Complaint before this
Court, for the Scandal: Your Lordships
did not think fit to try the Cause upon
that footing, but to come at the Bottom
of the whole Affair, order’d the Emperor’s
<i>Seniscal</i> to prosecute in this Manner.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>Thus the Tryal was at first brought
on by the Doctor himself; which he
now declines, why? because it’s not in
the Shape he projected, which shews a
more than ordinary Kind of Obstinacy
in his Temper, an Ingredient very unfit
to compose a Physician.</p>

<p class='c015'>But my learned Brother is likewise
mistaken in Point of Law; Tho’ we have
not the Precedents he mentions; yet it’s
founded on the Nature of Things: The
august Emperor has an Interest in the
Life of every Subject; and is in Reality
in the Quality of Father to each of
them; and often more a Parent than
their own natural Fathers: Does he not
in all other criminal Cases, prosecute
without the Consent of the Party damag’d;
why may he not then in this?
Unless the Physicians claim a Priviledge
not common to the rest of the Subjects
of this Empire.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Court, after a short Debate, overruled
the Objection to the Indictment;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>and ordered the Prisoner to plead; he
thereupon pleaded not guilty; and submitted
to the Judgment of the Court.</p>

<p class='c015'>Here the Court broke up and adjourned
the farther hearing to next Day, when
the learned Body being again assembled,
in Court, and the President seated in the
Formalites as before gave Orders for proceeding
on the Tryal, which was accordingly
done by the Council for the Emperor,
who rising up opened the Case as
follows.</p>

<p class='c015'>My Lord, the Prosecutors for his Imperial
Majesty, are so far from taking any
rigorous Advantage of the learned <a id='tn7'></a>Genman
at the Bar, that they are resolved
to try the Cause upon his own State of
the Case now in the <i>Mandarin</i> Secretary’s
Hand: They are to suppose, that he has
according to his Duty, fairly stated the
Symptoms of the Disease under which his
Right Honourable Patient laboured; and
that he has given a just Account of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>Medicines he ordered to be administred in
order to effectuate a Cure; and from this
his own State of the Facts, we hope to
convince this august Court, that the Doctor,
has followed a Practice, quite different
from those prescribed by your
Lordships in similar Cases; apply’d Medicines
improper for the Patient’s Distemper;
and in every Circumstance, acted,
as if he rather <a id='tn8'></a>intended, to increase the
Malady, than save his Patient’s Life; we
shall make it appear, that the Doctor instead
of assisting Nature, has endeavoured
to convert the Order of Things, and obstructed
her as much as lay in his Power;
and we shall likewise make it appear beyond
Conjecture, that the Method used
with the Patient, during the Process of
his Illness; hasten’d his End, much more
than the Fever it self: Out of Respect to
the <i>Diploma</i> issuing out of the Court,
which entitled the learned Gentleman to
practice the divine Science of <a id='tn9'></a>Physick,
we dare not attribute his Misconduct to
Ignorance; Charity forbids us to suppose
it Malice; and good Manners hinders
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>us to use the Word Obstinacy; but to
whatever Motive we may ascribe it the
Facts are incontestable, and the Effects have
been fatal to the noble Lord once an illustrious
Member of this great Court.</p>

<p class='c015'>Your Lordships, will observe from
the Case, that a reumatick Fever, attended
with Pains in the Limbs and a sore
Throat, was the Disorder which afflicted
the <i>Mandarin</i> <span class='sc'>Tonwin</span>, and there never
was during the seventeen Days which the
Fever lasted, any thing else administred,
to obtain a Cure; but Bleeding and Purging;
how far that was proper in the Patients
Circumstances, we shall very soon
determine, we are to observe, that from
the Beginning of the Doctors Attendance,
the Patient shewed a great Disposition to
sweat; especially in the Night-time, when
it was sometimes according to the Doctors
Report, to Excess. This My Lord,
we look upon as an Attempt of Nature,
to get rid of the malignant feverish Matter,
which oppress’d her, by Means of
Perspiration; and is by all Physicians,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>looked upon as the most common as well
as the most natural Crisis of all feverish
Disorders; it was my Lord the Doctors
Duty, to have taken hold of this favourable
Disposition of Nature, to have assisted
her, by giving Medicines which
would have provoked Perspiration: But
he followed a quite different Course; he
willfully obstructed the Grand Physician;
instead of encouraging the Sweat, he made
the Patient get out of Bed to avoid it;
seem’d obstinately bent to obtain a Cure
by nothing but purging and bleeding.</p>

<p class='c015'>As to the purging, he alledges the
Patient was costive; we admit he was;
but does it follow from thence, that he
must be purged for seventeen Days together:
The harder the Patient was to
work upon, the greater Reason the Doctor
had to desist purging; especially using
any Medicine that would inflame the
Bowels, which Jallop certainly does;
purging naturally weakens the strongest
Constitution, without the Assistance of
an acute Distemper; but how weak must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>that Patient be, who suffer’d the Weight
of both, and another Evacuation as destructive
of natural Strength as the other,
<i>viz.</i> Bleeding. As to the Bleeding, the
Doctor would insinuate from this Case,
that he could not take too much Blood
from the Patient, since notwithstanding
the monstrous Quantity taken, the Vessels
seemed overcharged, and it burst out at
the Nostrils; but the Doctor is not aware
that two Causes absolutely different, will
produce the self same Effect as too great
a Quantity of Blood may produce an Hemorrage;
and too small a Quantity the
same; in the one Case the Vessels are distended
beyond their proper Tone, and in
the other as much below it; which was
certainly the Case of the honourable Patient
unhappily the Subject of the present
Debate; the Texture of the Blood and
Vessels were broken by the vast Quantity
taken away, and a Mortification of the
Ulcers in the Throat naturally followed;
as Nature had not sufficient Strength left,
to stimulate the Blood, and keep it in its
proper Motion; besides, the Regimen of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>Dyet prescribed by the Doctor, was quite
preposterous; Milk is naturally hot, and
as it is of the Nature of prepared Chyle,
turns too soon to Aliment, to be proper in
those Diseases, which require the Patient
to be kept low; upon the whole your
Lordship will be of Opinion, that Nature
itself would have operated a Crisis, had
she not been interrupted by the Doctor;
and that the excessive Bleeding and Purging,
only hastened the Approach of his
Angel of Death; therefore we hope your
Lordships will find the Prisoner guilty,
in order to deter others from following
their own Conceits, in Cases where the
Life of a Subject is concerned.</p>

<p class='c015'>My Lord, the Charge against our
learned Client, as open’d by my Brother
the Attorney General, is of a very deep
Nature; but I hope we shall convince this
august Court, that the whole Prosecution
is founded upon Malice, and has no other
Foundation; but the Envy of some of the
Doctors Brethren, who can not with any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>Patience, see any Reformation in their old
Practice; they are Men so wedded to old
antiquated Opinions, and superanuated Customs,
that the strongest Reason cannot
convince their Understandings, or the
most glaring Truths, have any Influence
upon their obstinate Minds, they are all
a Parcel of old Women, who have learned
a Sett of Notions from their Grandmothers,
which they argue upon without
Reason; and put in Practice necessarily on
all Occasions, and are now so old, that
like Children they cannot walk without
Leading-strings.</p>

<p class='c015'>Your Lordships are sensible, that its
impossible to lay down any certain Rules
for the Practice of Physick; they must differ
as Constitutions, Times and Seasons, alter
those Regulations, which might have been
reasonable in the Days of our Grandfathers,
are now out of Date; the Luxury
of the present Age, the difference in Dyet,
Exercise and Diversions of the present Generation,
have produced a new Catalogue
of Diseases, unknown to our Ancestors;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>and for which our antient Writers have
not so much as dreamed of a Cure now;
when the old Women of the Faculty meet
with any such, they still persist in their
old Recipes; and by that means killed
thousands of his Majesty’s Subjects every Day
with Impunity; and that out of Laziness,
that they will not be at the Trouble to search
for new Cures to new Cases; now our Client
has been more indefatigable, he has
found out not only a Cure more expeditious
for our old Native Distempers; but one
that will totally eradicate all our exotick Diseases
with which this great Empire abounds;
he does not mean to keep this great Catholicon
a Secret, he is proud of having this
Opportunity of divulging it to Mankind, for
whose Benefit he has laboured till he is
grown expert in the <i>Profession</i>; his <i>Recipe</i> is
short and eazy, its only <i>Bleed</i> and <i>Purge</i>:
He apprehends the Reasonableness of this
Practice, is like a self-evident Truth in the
Mathematicks; all Diseases flow from peccant
Humours, being mix’d with the Mass
of Blood, which are so closely united to it,
that they cannot be discharged by Perspirations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>or other natural Secretions; <i>but if you
purge and bleed away all the Humours in the
Body, we are sure none that are peccant will
remain Quod erat Demonstrandum</i>. This
answers all Cases, all Circumstances, Times,
Seasons and Climates, and is an Improvement
in Physick, for which we hope our Client
will be rewarded with a Statue instead of a
H——r.</p>

<p class='c015'>They have made a deal of Pother about
Sweating, but is it not plain, that alone
would not have served the Patient; when
its well known that in Spite of all the
Doctors Endeavours to hinder it, it increased
immoderately, and yet produced
no such wonderful Effects as they would
attribute to it: Grant that Bleeding and
Purging weakens; so does Sweating; our
Client My Lord, apprehends, that if he
had bled more plentifully, he would at
least have got the better of the Fever
some Days sooner than he did; the Patient
might have died its true, but that
would not have been his Fault if he had
used the Means to disburthen him of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>his Blood, where the Malady lay; therefore
we hope the Court will acquit the
Prisoner.</p>

<p class='c015'>Its not the Custom in that Country
for the Judge to give a Charge as there
is no Jury, but the Prisoner was ordered
to withdraw, and in a little Time he was
called back and acquainted with his Sentence,
which we must beg of the Publick
to excuse us from publishing.</p>
